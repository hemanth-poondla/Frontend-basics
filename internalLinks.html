               <h4>Commenting</h4>
               <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, 
                  especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the 
                  cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, 
                  original author, modifications and authors who modified code 
                  with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.
